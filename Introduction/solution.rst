My Initial experience in Python Summer Training 2013
----------------------------------------------------
I am Puspita Ghosh, a student of MCA final year from BCREC. Initail few days of the training was highly confusing for me.People were flooding with questions of which most of it I couldn't catch up to. But eventualy i could cope up to it. This is also true that I find the instructions a bit unclear. That may be your style of training which makes us independent learners. I'm realy looking forward to this training. After what i heard about Sayan and Souradeep I'm have a lot of hope wth this training. 

P.S I like programming and always find interest in learing new programming languages.
